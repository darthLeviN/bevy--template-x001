Currently setting up a template to make a game with bevy. it's lacking some things. so far i have setup

- Event handler
- UI page navigation stack (allows a stack of pages to pop for the parent page to show up)
- Scene based ui spawning
- Focus handling (ESC will release focus if the input event remains unhandled)

Next is to implement :
- Text input handler.
- Setup an app config/user storage.
- Add anything needed to handle game assets efficiently.
- Make some prepared UI controls like styled buttons.
